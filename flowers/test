Hello @mukulmc03, welcome to the GitHub Support Community!

You can also create new folders by simply dragging and dropping a folder with files to your repository on GitHub and then uploading them. If you want the folder youâ€™re uploading to be inside a specific sub-folder, be sure to click on and enter that sub-folder before uploading your files.
